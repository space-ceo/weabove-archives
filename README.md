The Archivist files for WeAbove

All the content in this repository is 100% the intellectual property of [WeAbove](https://twitter.com/weaboveofficial).

I own nothing, just compiling all the archive fragments from The Archivist in the WeAbove discord into a maintainable format
with historical tracking - hoping it helps with lore detective work!
