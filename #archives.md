[Archive Fragment K82.5.8 Recovered]\
It doesn’t feel like that long ago when we used the gravite to break the world, but it's been almost 300 years since the Upfall. It doesn’t matter that it was an accident, that we were trying to save everyone; the Earth is still shattered. We are still living on floating remnants so high up that we scrap the void.\
[Archive Fragment K82.6.1 Recovered]\
Resources are running out. Factions and principalities, fanatical cults and bandit clans, communities and individuals; all struggle over every scrap of inhabitable land, every drop of water, every morsel of food, every grain of gravite.\
[Archive Fragment K82.2.11 Recovered]\
Though it is what doomed us all, the gravite still contains marvels locked within its crystalline structure. Marvels that could save us, or could doom us all over again as the last vestiges of humanity use it to create powerful weapons in their war for dominance over a broken world.

"To control a thing, one must first know it. Through Nucleus Flux Tracking, we will be able to know both ally and enemy. Their images and data will be stored within the N.F.T. Records. In time, all will be recorded, all will be known, all will be controlled."

Computers, beakers, and delicate electronic equipment rattled in their drawers as barren shelves and desks shivered against the nails that held them to plaster and wood. It was already the fourth quake this morning; each one worse than the last. Each day they got more frequent and more violent. Local EU representatives were recommending that everyone in town evacuate to the quake resistant shelters before the end of the week. Ugly gel filled tents that smelt of burnt rubber and could withstand quakes up to a magnitude of 8.5 without damage.

Simone knew she couldn’t leave. Her work was here. In the lab where she and her team had discovered the process for bombarding the planet’s core with exotic graviton particles and solved the greatest crisis Earth had seen since the dinosaurs woke up to a fiery rock blotting out the sky. Where now she worked day and night to solve an even greater crisis. The disaster they created by stabilizing Earth’s magnetic field against the Sun’s rather persistent attempts to cook all life with lethal radiation, and in turn destabilized the Earth’s tectonic plates. Best intentions and all that.

At least the ocean life might have survived all that cosmic radiation, sheltered in the dark and chilly depths. Now they will probably be the first to go when the seafloor rips apart and the oceans go roaring down into the Earth’s upper mantle. Less than a week before anyone surviving is living in those hideous tents as the works of mankind all come tumbling down. A week after that, magnitude 9+ quakes would be hitting globally a few times a day. After that, it would be less than a month before the whole planet broke itself into massive chunks floating through the void.

So what’s the point in evacuating, when the only hope humanity had was with her in her lab, working to solve the cataclysm that she caused. Who wanted to die in a disgusting jelly filled tent anyways?

“Dr. Pelta. We are ready for the phase 3 radiation test.”

Most of her colleagues and assistants had listened to the cautious government warnings, preferring to flee from their guilt and shame over taking responsibility for the calamities they had wrought. But a few had stayed, some of the best and brightest with both the intelligence to know that a solution was possible and the moral integrity to stay and try even if it wasn’t. Mikołaj Turowicz was one such individual. He didn’t even have his doctorate, yet he stayed and worked tirelessly at Simone’s side, while scientists with 40 years of lab experience went running off to hide in government camps and await their death.

“Let’s hope this is the one that works. And if not this one…” Simone said, just as she said before every test.

“...then the next one.” Mikołaj echoed, completing the ritual with a soft smile.

Together they walked through the empty hallways, and down the stairs towards the particle accelerator housed in the lab’s basement complex. Both of them doing their best to ignore the ever growing lines spreading through the concrete walls, cracking paint and leaving a fine layer of dust over everything. The particle accelerator was probably the safest place to be, even more so than tents of jelly. The whole underground complex was encased in a reinforced shell, suspended in a semi-liquid membrane. It might outlast us all, Simone thought, as she moved quickly down the several sets of stairs.

“Wish we could still use the elevator.” Mikołaj said, looking mournfully at the sealed metal door that would have made his many trips up and down the 15 stories between the accelerator and the lab a little quicker and a lot less energy intensive. Scientists weren't known for their physical stamina.

Simone cracked a brief and tired smile. The only kind she could manage these days. “By all means, take the chance. But if you get stuck in the elevator for 8 hours like Dr. Martins did, you’re fired.”

Mikołaj’s grin was quick and broad. As it always was. “You wouldn’t be able to fire me fast enough. I would quit immediately in great shame and dishonor!”

Simone gave a nod to acknowledge his banter, but a second smile was just too much for her. She didn’t know how Mikołaj could maintain his jubilant disposition in such dark times. Perhaps it was because he wasn’t the “genius” who had brought about the end of the world, only her assistant.

The observation chamber was a cramped 10 by 10 cube, crowded with panels, screens, and dials. Two lab techs were going over power readouts, making adjustments as needed. They didn’t look up when Simone and Mikołaj entered, but they sat up a little straighter, at attention for Simone’s orders.

Simone couldn’t help compare the stark differences between now and the experiment which had saved and doomed the world in a single stroke. The massive particle generator had been built upon the San Andreas faultline, north of Los Angeles. The air had been painfully dry, and protestors lined the whole drive from the city to the facility, exposed to the merciless Sun. The observation chamber there had been quite large so it could fit all the VIP guests and world leaders, apparently eager to watch as she killed the world. The particle generator shook the whole complex as it came to life; engines, tubes, and exotic particles thrumming their horrible chorus like the seven trumpets of Revelations.

In the margins of her notes that day she had written her own prophetic warning. “"As we prepare to impose our will upon our Mother Earth, I worry that humanity's eternal quest for order and control will be what dooms us to endless chaos." And then someone (was it Dr. Ramanujan or the US President maybe?) pressed the button. How many of the terrible fulcrums of history been the single bush of a button? Time to press yet another.

“Petra, are all fields aligned?” Simone knew they were, Petra was the best at what she did, but she had to go through the checklist in her head every time, otherwise she would never be comfortable starting the test.

“Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta fields are all within test parameters.” The tall, gangly tech said as she checked several screens with a swivel of her chair.

“Jacobs. Time before the next quake?”

“Calculations say we have 37 minutes, boss.” The young man said, scratching at his overgrown beard. Grooming had gone out the window during the apocalypse, but faster for some than others.

Simone turned to Mikołaj, trying not to let the glimmer of hope show in her eyes.

The man smiled and nodded. 37 minutes was enough time to finish the test and maybe save the world.

“Alright. We have a go. Petra, it's all yours.” Simone settled herself into a wobbly office chair, and then stood up again immediately. Petra gathered in a nervous breath before pressing the big red button with the palm of a sweaty hand, initiating the test.

The ever present whirl of the generators rose to a sharp whine as they sucked up power to produce the necessary magnetic fields used to propel tiny exotic particles to impossible speeds before smashing them together. A series of muffled concu…*Corrupted*
