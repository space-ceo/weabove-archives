[Outside of the major factions, most advanced technology is used for industrial purposes or for ensuring survival. The average person has access to very little advanced tech. What little they may have has been traded, stolen, or smuggled from the Ordos or another major faction, or is some pre-Upfall relic lovingly preserved and handed down from generation to generation.]
> 
> [MARINE LIFE]\
[With the loss of almost all large bodies of saltwater as they drained away into the cracks and fissures of a broken planet, almost all ocean life is extinct. There are no more whales, sharks, coral reefs, giant schools of fish, etc. Crustaceans, some species of saltwater fish, and a few other lucky creatures survive in smaller seas of saltwater created by intact low elevation areas that kept parts of the ocean contained as the rest drained away. The notable exception to this is the Medit Lakes, formed from parts of the Mediterranean and Black Seas.]
> 
> [FRAGMENT FROM TRADE ARCHIVE]\
[The [REDACTED] prefer the system of barter and trade that has become the norm across the world. Some clans can be noble and fair traders, while others might be swindlers and thieves, but all find a way to work within or exploit the system to a degree that the [REDACTED] and the [REDACTED] rarely do.]
> 
> [FRAGMENT FROM SOCIOLOGY ARCHIVE]\
While the major factions maintain dominant control over the remnants of Earth, the lack of reliable communication and travel between landmasses make this control tenuous at best. Many communities exist beneath notice, just surviving best they can, day by day.

>[The Umbral Compact]\
>Since the Upfall, criminal organizations have struggled with each other and fought against attempts from lawful authorities to control them. This struggle continued until the Crossed Horns gained dominance in the underworld during the Umbral Conflicts. A quick series of battles, bribes and betrayals, thefts and slaughter within the Fractures and in the lands above that showed that the Crossed Horns had no equal.\
>The Umbral Compact was created to keep the Crossed Horns in check, as the other clandestine groups joined together to resist them. In the end it was all for naught. With the rise of the Ordos they were driven back down into the Fractures, where Freo Clans picked them apart bit by bit until they were a mere shadow of their former glory.]
