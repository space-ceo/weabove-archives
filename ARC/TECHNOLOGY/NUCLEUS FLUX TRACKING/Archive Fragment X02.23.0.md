While researching the practical application of quantum entanglement, Savant Bouth discovered that by exposing the nucleus of a carbon atom to a tight beam of gravitons at a specific frequency, the nucleus can be made to emit infrequent bursts of bosons that could be detected at long distances, ignoring matter and most energy interference. Thus “tagging” the atom and any object or person it is part of. As these bursts were unique to the atom affected, information could be sent over vast distances at high speeds by amplifying certain atoms over others in set sequences, as long as the receiver knew what each unique signal meant.
